# MyReads: A Book Lending App
Final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course 
([see more](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019))

## Project Overview
This app allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. 

## Install and Start
The application was created with create-react-app and requires only `npm install` and `npm start` to get it installed and launched.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
